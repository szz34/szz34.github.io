I studied at the School of Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence at Wuhan University of Technology from 2018 to 2022, where I earned a Bachelor's degree in Engineering. In September 2022, I joined the College of Computer Science and Software Engineering at Shenzhen University and am currently pursuing a Master's degree under the supervision of [Asst. Prof. Zhidan Liu](https://liuzhidan.github.io/).

My research interests include: transfer learning, urban computing, and data mining.
